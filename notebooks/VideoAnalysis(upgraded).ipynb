down for plate tectonics. What it is how it works and how we know about it so what. How does plate tectonics affect life in california or anywhere else for that matter. To answer that let's look at california's current plate tectonic setting. Is this map shows we have a number of plate boundaries within or near the state. Notice of the northern part of california we have a divergent plate boundary or an offshore seafloor spreading centre where new oceanic crust forms and then is pushed away. Here along the coast that crust collides with and then sings on the northern california. That produces a convergent plate. Reply with an oceanic crust leading-edge collides with the plate with continental crust on the edge. Result. Seduction. A trench earthquakes and inland active china volcanoes. This volcanic chain is known as the cascade mountains. And in california is expressed with the active volcanoes of mt lassen and mount shasta. The most recent eruption in an area was the explosive eruption depicted in this image of mount lassen on may 22nd 1915. What happens to the seafloor spreading centre off northern california. Like or such centres it is offset at regular intervals by transport box. If you move along the ridge north we hit this transform band. That then connect to the continuation of the spreading centres a bit west. If we go back and follow the ridge south we hit another transform. This one are sets the ridge eastwood. Where. Oh the way south to the sea of cortez where connect with the seafloor spreading centres that are separating the baja peninsula from the rest of mexico. This long transport boundary that connects these two sections of ocean ridge is known as the san andreas fault system. Those of us who live along its path a familiar with its associated earthquake hazards. The loma prieta earthquake in 1989. Was one of the most recent large earthquake. The magnitude 6.9 earthquake cause significant shaking and damage from santa cruz to san francisco as it released built up stress related to the transform plate motion. Why is the transform so long. What made it this way and why they seafloor spreading centre so close to the cotton and not in the middle of the ocean. This animation from the university of santa barbara shows with the pacific ocean look like 80 million years ago when the midleton register for spreading centre with always offset transport. Was actually close to the middle of the ocean. Notice what has happened over the past 80 million years. Is the atlantic ocean spread north america was pushed westwood. The western continental margin of north america with a large long subduction zone with associated volcanoes and terrain accretion. Brought out 25 million years ago the spreading centre began to be overrun. It's a dating on the north american continent. The san andreas fault system began to form. Pause now. Seduction now over the volcanism of this year nevada also ended. But what happened to that spreading. We can image the cross on a north america and see evidence of the old plates still seductive. And right above the start where we suspected spreading centre would now be we have an area of 10. With a condom cross has been pulled apart. Similar to the breakup of pangaea. The crystal stretching has created some parallel mountains and valleys collectively known as the basin and range. I'm on the westernmost edge the sierra nevada mountains are being pulled up out of the ground causing high rates of erosion and exposure of deep granite rock parties that are there now frozen remnants of the magma chambers that used to feed the active subduction volcanoes. So walking in glacier lee card yosemite. Is actually walking along the remnants of all volcanic cores. What else results from the stretching of the basin and range. In addition to exposing the eroded underbelly of ancient syrian vulcan. The roosting activity is also producing a source of new volcanism to the area. The resulting volcanoes are completely different in character and cars to subduction zone volcanoes. Ghost binding more voluminous cinema supply. A more explosive in eruptive style. Mammoth mountain is 1 volcanic structure found in the middle of this region known collectively as long valley. In this region of rifting and thin crust mantle rock is melting in rising beneath the surface just like what happens at sea for spreading divergent plate boundaries. Mental maths combined with large amounts of crust on. Collecting a giant magma chamber just under the surface. The long valley caldera is a giant crater left behind after one of the largest volcanic eruptions to happen in north america. Emptied the magma chamber and the surrounding crash collapsed. The last eruption about 760000 years ago last bits of strewn across most of the western united states. There's still an active magma chamber under the caldera which releases carbon dioxide gases and hot water in numerous locations around the room. It has been classified as one of the largest volcanic centres in north america. The most recent eruptions were those that produced panam crater and the in your creator. 500 to 600 years ago. Let's leave this unique volcanic region and return to the remnants of the ancient seduction.com volcanoes now exposes granite in the central and western series. If you want to experience some of this. The sender is fault is done a great job of moving rocks around in the sea. As a result of the transfer motion sections of the southern sierra nevada granite were separated from their originations for interiors northwich. Received them today as far north as raise. They also make up the rock of montana. And the rock at the fairmont ireland. Pause now. What about the rest of the rock around us where did that come. Well some of the rock that makes up the santa cruz mountains in the hills of san francisco. Times of coastal sediments during changing sea levels and ice ages the majority of it consists of individual blocks of terrains that were created during the past periods of seduction. Prior to the collision of a mid-ocean ridge with a subduction zones there were hundreds of millions of years of active seduction. During that time oceancraft was carried into the subduction zones and portions of audit carried were scraped off and attached to the edge of the can't. Extending the continent westwood in a paper mache style sequence of edition or accretion. A cream material can include ocean sediment they got scraped off the top of the subducting plate. Carnival sediment that would have pulled off the continental shelf into the trench ocean sea monster island that would have gotten stuck in a trench and scraped off sections of the entire oceanic crust. And metamorphic rocks produced during collision and seduction. As you can see plate tectonics has had a huge impact on a past and present landscape of california. It produces many of our major geologic hazards and it is rafting in and then combined the very land masses that now make-up estate. Take a field trip to one of these near my location. Well you can see the evidence and walk on the old surfaces yourself. Pause now.

basics down for plate tectonics. What it is how it works and how we know about it so what. How does plate tectonics affect life in california or anywhere else for that matter. To answer that let's look at california's current plate tectonic setting. Is this map shows we have a number of plate boundaries within or near the state. Notice of the northern part of california we have a divergent plate boundary or an offshore seafloor spreading centre where new oceanic crust forms and then is pushed away. Here along the coast that crust collides with and then sings on the northern california. That produces a convergent plate. Reply with an oceanic crust leading-edge collides with the plate with continental crust on the edge. Result. Seduction. A trench earthquakes and inland active china volcanoes. This volcanic chain is known as the cascade mountains. And in california is expressed with the active volcanoes of mt lassen and mount shasta. The most recent eruption in an area was the explosive eruption depicted in this image of mount lassen on may 22nd 1915. What happens to the seafloor spreading centre off northern california. Like or such centres it is offset at regular intervals by transport box. If you move along the ridge north we hit this transform band. That then connect to the continuation of the spreading centres a bit west. If we go back and follow the ridge south we hit another transform. This one are sets the ridge eastwood. Where. Oh the way south to the sea of cortez where connect with the seafloor spreading centres that are separating the baja peninsula from the rest of mexico. This long transport boundary that connects these two sections of ocean ridge is known as the san andreas fault system. Those of us who live along its path a familiar with its associated earthquake hazards. The loma prieta earthquake in 1989. Was one of the most recent large earthquake. The magnitude 6.9 earthquake cause significant shaking and damage from santa cruz to san francisco as it released built up stress related to the transform plate motion. Why is the transform so long. What made it this way and why they seafloor spreading centre so close to the cotton and not in the middle of the ocean. This animation from the university of santa barbara shows with the pacific ocean look like 80 million years ago when the midleton register for spreading centre with always offset transport. Was actually close to the middle of the ocean. Notice what has happened over the past 80 million years. Is the atlantic ocean spread north america was pushed westwood. The western continental margin of north america with a large long subduction zone with associated volcanoes and terrain accretion. Brought out 25 million years ago the spreading centre began to be overrun. It's a dating on the north american continent. The san andreas fault system began to form. Pause now. Seduction now over the volcanism of this year nevada also ended. But what happened to that spreading. We can image the cross on a north america and see evidence of the old plates still seductive. And right above the start where we suspected spreading centre would now be we have an area of 10. With a condom cross has been pulled apart. Similar to the breakup of pangaea. The crystal stretching has created some parallel mountains and valleys collectively known as the basin and range. I'm on the westernmost edge the sierra nevada mountains are being pulled up out of the ground causing high rates of erosion and exposure of deep granite rock parties that are there now frozen remnants of the magma chambers that used to feed the active subduction volcanoes. So walking in glacier lee card yosemite. Is actually walking along the remnants of all volcanic cores. What else results from the stretching of the basin and range. In addition to exposing the eroded underbelly of ancient syrian vulcan. The roosting activity is also producing a source of new volcanism to the area. The resulting volcanoes are completely different in character and cars to subduction zone volcanoes. Ghost binding more voluminous cinema supply. A more explosive in eruptive style. Mammoth mountain is 1 volcanic structure found in the middle of this region known collectively as long valley. In this region of rifting and thin crust mantle rock is melting in rising beneath the surface just like what happens at sea for spreading divergent plate boundaries. Mental maths combined with large amounts of crust on. Collecting a giant magma chamber just under the surface. The long valley caldera is a giant crater left behind after one of the largest volcanic eruptions to happen in north america. Emptied the magma chamber and the surrounding crash collapsed. The last eruption about 760000 years ago last bits of strewn across most of the western united states. There's still an active magma chamber under the caldera which releases carbon dioxide gases and hot water in numerous locations around the room. It has been classified as one of the largest volcanic centres in north america. The most recent eruptions were those that produced panam crater and the in your creator. 500 to 600 years ago. Let's leave this unique volcanic region and return to the remnants of the ancient seduction.com volcanoes now exposes granite in the central and western series. If you want to experience some of this. The sender is fault is done a great job of moving rocks around in the sea. As a result of the transfer motion sections of the southern sierra nevada granite were separated from their originations for interiors northwich. Received them today as far north as raise. They also make up the rock of montana. And the rock at the fairmont ireland. Pause now. What about the rest of the rock around us where did that come. Well some of the rock that makes up the santa cruz mountains in the hills of san francisco. Times of coastal sediments during changing sea levels and ice ages the majority of it consists of individual blocks of terrains that were created during the past periods of seduction. Prior to the collision of a mid-ocean ridge with a subduction zones there were hundreds of millions of years of active seduction. During that time oceancraft was carried into the subduction zones and portions of audit carried were scraped off and attached to the edge of the can't. Extending the continent westwood in a paper mache style sequence of edition or accretion. A cream material can include ocean sediment they got scraped off the top of the subducting plate. Carnival sediment that would have pulled off the continental shelf into the trench ocean sea monster island that would have gotten stuck in a trench and scraped off sections of the entire oceanic crust. And metamorphic rocks produced during collision and seduction. As you can see plate tectonics has had a huge impact on a past and present landscape of california. It produces many of our major geologic hazards and it is rafting in and then combined the very land masses that now make-up estate. Take a field trip to one of these near my location. Well you can see the evidence and walk on the old surfaces yourself. Pause now. For more information in more detail continue onto the next video in the series.

In this region of rifting and thin crust mantle rock is melting in rising beneath the surface just like what happens at sea for spreading divergent plate boundaries. The western continental margin of north america with a large long subduction zone with associated volcanoes and terrain accretion. This long transport boundary that connects these two sections of ocean ridge is known as the san andreas fault system. The magnitude 6.9 earthquake cause significant shaking and damage from santa cruz to san francisco as it released built up stress related to the transform plate motion. Oh the way south to the sea of cortez where connect with the seafloor spreading centres that are separating the baja peninsula from the rest of mexico. Reply with an oceanic crust leading-edge collides with the plate with continental crust on the edge. Brought out 25 million years ago the spreading centre began to be overrun. The long valley caldera is a giant crater left behind after one of the largest volcanic eruptions to happen in north america. Let's leave this unique volcanic region and return to the remnants of the ancient seduction.com volcanoes now exposes granite in the central and western series. What made it this way and why they seafloor spreading centre so close to the cotton and not in the middle of the ocean. Mammoth mountain is 1 volcanic structure found in the middle of this region known collectively as long valley. Prior to the collision of a mid-ocean ridge with a subduction zones there were hundreds of millions of years of active seduction. What happens to the seafloor spreading centre off northern california. And in california is expressed with the active volcanoes of mt lassen and mount shasta. Is the atlantic ocean spread north america was pushed westwood. How does plate tectonics affect life in california or anywhere else for that matter. During that time oceancraft was carried into the subduction zones and portions of audit carried were scraped off and attached to the edge of the can't. The most recent eruption in an area was the explosive eruption depicted in this image of mount lassen on may 22nd 1915. We can image the cross on a north america and see evidence of the old plates still seductive. And right above the start where we suspected spreading centre would now be we have an area of 10. There's still an active magma chamber under the caldera which releases carbon dioxide gases and hot water in numerous locations around the room. It has been classified as one of the largest volcanic centres in north america. Well some of the rock that makes up the santa cruz mountains in the hills of san francisco. As you can see plate tectonics has had a huge impact on a past and present landscape of california. The last eruption about 760000 years ago last bits of strewn across most of the western united states. As a result of the transfer motion sections of the southern sierra nevada granite were separated from their originations for interiors northwich. Is this map shows we have a number of plate boundaries within or near the state. If you move along the ridge north we hit this transform band. The crystal stretching has created some parallel mountains and valleys collectively known as the basin and range. The resulting volcanoes are completely different in character and cars to subduction zone volcanoes. That then connect to the continuation of the spreading centres a bit west. A cream material can include ocean sediment they got scraped off the top of the subducting plate. To answer that let's look at california's current plate tectonic setting. Mental maths combined with large amounts of crust on. Here along the coast that crust collides with and then sings on the northern california. Like or such centres it is offset at regular intervals by transport box. The san andreas fault system began to form. Is actually walking along the remnants of all volcanic cores. So now we have the basics down for plate tectonics. This volcanic chain is known as the cascade mountains. Notice what has happened over the past 80 million years. A trench earthquakes and inland active china volcanoes. Seduction now over the volcanism of this year nevada also ended. Received them today as far north as raise. Extending the continent westwood in a paper mache style sequence of edition or accretion. It produces many of our major geologic hazards and it is rafting in and then combined the very land masses that now make-up estate. If we go back and follow the ridge south we hit another transform. It's a dating on the north american continent. Collecting a giant magma chamber just under the surface. Emptied the magma chamber and the surrounding crash collapsed. The most recent eruptions were those that produced panam crater and the in your creator. Those of us who live along its path a familiar with its associated earthquake hazards. Pause now. The sender is fault is done a great job of moving rocks around in the sea. The roosting activity is also producing a source of new volcanism to the area. 500 to 600 years ago. What about the rest of the rock around us where did that come. Was actually close to the middle of the ocean. In addition to exposing the eroded underbelly of ancient syrian vulcan. And the rock at the fairmont ireland. And metamorphic rocks produced during collision and seduction. This one are sets the ridge eastwood. The loma prieta earthquake in 1989. Was one of the most recent large earthquake. With a condom cross has been pulled apart.
